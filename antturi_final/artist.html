      Madelyne Klein is a jewelry designer working at the intersection of tradition and novelty. Much of her work is
      informed by family history and her original inspiration: heirlooms passed down through generations. Explorations
      into Victorian-era designs and the repurposing of antique jewelry allow Madelyne to seek structure from the past
      while simultaneously searching for adventure in the contemporary. Having studied in both New York and London, her
      explorations into the geographical significance of design have inspired her work to reflect her surroundings. With
      a passion for both metal and beading work, her experience in both practices gives way to a multifaceted approach
      as she continues to develop and refine her voice.
