        <h2>History of Blue</h2>
        <p>Blue, a primary color, seen above in our sky, and below in our seas, holds a wide range of applications and representations both practically and thematically. Historically, blue had been desirable and symbolic amongst royalty, stemming from rare blue minerals and dyes. Following World War II, the color has been gendered to be associated most closely with males. This can be seen commonly today in childrens clothing, toys, and signage.</p>
        <h2>Blue as a feeling</h2>
        <P>In art blue has long been used as a theme to represent a number of tones and emotions. Emotionally, the color is most closely associated with feelings of sadness and depression. The expression, “Feeling Blue”, believed to have emerged in the 17th century, is a popular idiom in the English language today. Artists and musicians alike have often used this blue association to viscerally communicate a deep and intense sadness, from Vincent Van Gogh to Miles Davis and Joni Mitchell.</P>
