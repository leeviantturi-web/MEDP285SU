    <h4>What do you hope to learn in this class?</h4>

    <p>In class, I hope to learn more about how I can present my media in an effective and interesting way through my own webpage.</p>



    <h4>Do you have experience with coding (html, css, javascript)?
    </h4>
    <p> I have taken a few classes, one in Computer Science and another in Media, which gave me some experience in coding. This limited experience was very interesting and I am excited to build on this, building on my overall media skills.</p>
    <h4>Do you have a media production superpower (Photoshop, Photography, Animation, Illustration, etc.)?
    </h4>
    <p> I believe that video editing is my main focus and strength in media production. Using Adobe Premiere, I enjoy editing short films and videos of skateboarding.  </p>
