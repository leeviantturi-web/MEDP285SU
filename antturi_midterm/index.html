        <h2>History of Skate Filming</h2>
        <p>Combining spontaneous, chaotic documentary style filmmaking, with the often intensely rehearsed and technical subject of skate maneauvers, skateboard films have for decades presented a raw picture of cityscapes and countercultures. "Filmer" is skateboarding's characteristically laid back title for the camera operator, who typically also simultaniously plays the role of director, editor, and music supervisor. With private property often as the films set, without any proper permitting, recording skateboarding presents challenges of interference and legality. Skaters and filmers maneuvering through uncontrolled enviorments, and often with the risk of private security or police interferance, recording is best done in on a smaller scale- often only the filmer and skater. Handheld camcorders have been the solution for these challenges in production, leading to a number of specific camcorders playing an important role in the history of skateboard documentation.</p>

        <p>From Super 8 film in it's genesis, to 4k UHD today, skateboard filming has gone through various distinct eras seen in the camera equipment used. While there is correlation between technological advances and the industries current favorite camera, the skateboarding world has at times been resitant to change. Aesthetic nostalgia has led to resistence to change regarding equipment, leading to specific cameras dominating skateboard filmmaking for beyond a decade.</p>
